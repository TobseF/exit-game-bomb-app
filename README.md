# üí£ ExitGame Bomb - Android App
 
This bomb is part of an **ExitGame** where payers have to deactivate a bomb by coding challenges.

The Bomb runs on an Android Device. It starts with a countdown before it explodes.
It's not accessible for the players. Players have to deactivate the bomb with coding challenges.
The deactivation commands are sent to an REST interface of the Bomb app.

## [üìö Bomb Instruction Manual](https://github.com/TobseF/its-exit-game-bomb/releases/download/v0.0.1/Bomb.Instruction.Manual.pdf)
The players read the [Bomb Instruction Manual](https://github.com/TobseF/its-exit-game-bomb/releases/download/v0.0.1/Bomb.Instruction.Manual.pdf) which helps
them to stop the bomb. Print it for them.

## üì° Remote Control
The players solve the puzzle by trigger unit tests which access the bombs REST API. There are two projects which can control the bomb:
1. **[Bomb-Client](https://github.com/TobseF/bomb-client).**  
  The client code with empty unit tests and access the the puzzle endpoints. The players try to disable the bomb remotely with this tests.
2. **[Bomb-Client-App](https://github.com/TobseF/bomb-client-app)**  
  The admin UI which can change settings of the bomb an check the bombs state. This is of course not available for the players.

## üöÄ Start
The App runs on Android and Desktop. So you can run, test and develop it without an Android device or emulator.
To start the app run the Gradle task:

* **Run Desktop:** _desktop > Tasks > other > run_
* **Run Android:** _android > Tasks > other > run_
* **Build Android:** _android > Tasks > build > build_

You can also run the `DesktopLauncher` class direct and skip the gradle build - which can be faster. 
Then you have to set the _Working directory_ of the _Run Configuration_ to  `${your-path}\bomb-app\android\assets`.

After an android build, the apps apks are present in `bomb-app\android\build\outputs\apk\debug` and `...\release`. You can install them with:  
`adb install -r "${full-path}\bomb-app\android\build\outputs\apk\debug\android-debug.apk"`

Run Gradle tasks with at least **[Gradle 5.5](https://gradle.org/install/)** and ensure it runs with a 
**[Java 1.8 JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)**.
You can check this here:

### üí° External Hardware
üí° The comb can be paired with external Hardware. It connects to a Phillips Hue bridge and controls lights.
So lights switch to ![RED](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) if the bomb gets activated and to 
![GREEN](https://placehold.it/15/c5f015/000000?text=+) if it gets disarmed. See `HueService` for details.

üîä To bomb also plays audio files, so it may be a good idea to connect it with an external Bluetooth speaker.

‚è∞ The bomb can connect to an external 7-segment hardware timer. See `TimerService` for details.

### ‚å® Controls
Available if _debug_ switch is on:
* Press <kbd>Space</kbd> to switch to the next screen.
* Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to trigger an action on a screen.

| `reset`   | PUT  | Start the bomb with a specific time in minutes.                    |
| `info`    | GET  | Reads the bomb state: `screen:LoginPuzzle;finish:1566910090308`.   |
| `connect` | PUT  | Try to solve the the `ConnectPuzzle`.                              |
| `numbers` | PUT  | Try to solve the the `NumbersPuzzle`.                              |

For endpoint details check the `com.libktx.game.endpoint` and `com.libktx.game.puzzle` packages.
You can find a sample implementation to control the bomb in the [Bomb-Client-App](https://github.com/TobseF/bomb-client-app).

Couldn't load file: icons/icon_16.png
```
You forgot to to set the _Working directory_ of the _Run Configuration_ to  `${your-path}\bomb-app\android\assets`.
